# RiboPy

 RiboPy is a set of tools to create, read and visualize .ribo files. It provides a Command Line Interface and Application Programming Interface to .ribo files.

## Installation

It is highly recommended to create and use a separate environment
using conda before installing RiboPy.

`pip install ribopy`

To install the latest version, use the code in Github

`pip install git+https://github.com/ribosomeprofiling/ribopy.git`

Although pip resolves dependencies and installs required packages automatically,
it is highly recommended that you install the dependencies using conda prior to issuing the pip installation command.

`conda env create -f environment.yml`

After the above command you can install RiboPy via pip, as shown above.


## Documentation

RiboPy documentation, for both command-line interface (CLI) and application programming interface (API), is available on [Read the Docs](https://ribopy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). Also, specification of [ribo file format](https://ribopy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ribo_file_format.html) is included in this documentation.
