def find_region_counts( coverage, annotation, left_span, right_span ):
    """
    Finds the number of counts for each region.

    Each transcript is partitioned into 5 regions:
    UTR5, UTR5_junction, CDS, UTR3_junction and UTR3

    The boundaries of these regions are as follows:
    Note that the second coordinate component is excluded

    UTR5 = [0, start_site - left_span ) 
    UTR5_junction: [start_site - left_span, start_site + right_span + 1 )

    UTR3: [ stop_site + right_span  +1, REF_length)

    Parameters
    ----------
    coverage: This is an ordered dict where 
              each keyword is a reference name each value is an array
              whose length is the nucleotide length of the refrence
              This array has the coverage of the given reference 
              in nucleotide level.
              So, for example, coverage["MYC"][10] 
              gives the number of nucleotides mapped to the 10th position
              of the MYC gene.

    left_span: Number of nucleotides to the left of the start / stop site.
               This is used to determine the junction regions.
            
    annotation: An list of triplets where each triplet is of the form
                (  [UTR3_star, UTR3_END], 
                   [CDS_start, CDS_end], 
                   [UTR5_Start, UTR5_end])
