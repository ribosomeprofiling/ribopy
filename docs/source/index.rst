RiboPy
===========

RiboPy is a set of tools to work with ribo files. 
Ribo is a file format designed specifically for ribosome profiling data. 
Ribo files contain essential quantitative entities such as 
metagene coverage and UTR5, CDS and UTR3 counts.

Ribo files are used for downstream analysis of ribosome profiling data. 
RiboPy provide interfaces to read and write ribo files as well as
generating plots.
